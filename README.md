# Husk - Windows Shell Configurator

Husk is a small application that will allow the user to easily change the default Windows Shell. It will allow changing of both the System and User Shells.

The application will only write to the two registry locations required by the Shell launching process. 

You can easily revert any changes back to the Windows default by pressing the reset buttons.
